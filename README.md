# Android Development Challenges for Expert Developers

## 1. Advanced UI Interaction App
**Description**: Create an app that utilizes complex UI components, animations, and gestures.

**Features**:
- Implement a custom view that allows for multi-touch gestures (pinch, rotate, swipe).
- Create a dynamic UI that reacts to sensor data (e.g., gyroscope, accelerometer).
- Implement a complex animation sequence that interacts with user input and sensor data.

## 2. Real-time Collaboration App
**Description**: Build an app where multiple users can collaborate in real-time, similar to Google Docs but for drawing or note-taking.

**Features**:
- Use WebSockets or Firebase Realtime Database for real-time data synchronization.
- Implement user authentication and allow users to join specific collaboration rooms.
- Provide features like live cursors, drawing tools, and text tools.

## 3. Offline-first Architecture App
**Description**: Design an app that works seamlessly offline and syncs data when online.

**Features**:
- Implement a local database using Room.
- Use WorkManager to manage sync tasks.
- Handle conflict resolution when data is modified offline and differs from the server version.

## 4. Advanced Camera App with Image Processing
**Description**: Create an app that uses the Camera2 API to capture photos and then applies custom image processing.

**Features**:
- Manual controls for focus, exposure, and white balance.
- Implement custom shaders using OpenGL for real-time image effects.
- Provide features like RAW image capture, HDR processing, and panorama stitching.

## 5. Security-focused App
**Description**: Build an app that stores sensitive user data securely.

**Features**:
- Implement biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition).
- Use Android Keystore to generate and store cryptographic keys securely.
- Implement end-to-end encryption for any data transmitted between the app and a server.
